INSTALLATION
============
 
  `latex etoc.dtx' --> this extracts the style file `etoc.sty'
 
  `latex etoc.dtx' (twice more) finishes producing the documentation
 
   Move `etoc.sty' to a suitable location within the TeX installation:
           etoc.sty -> <TDS>/tex/latex/etoc/etoc.sty
 
   The generated auxiliary files may be discarded.

ABSTRACT
========

  The etoc package gives to the user complete control on how
  the entries of the table of contents should be constituted
  from the name, number, and page number of each sectioning
  unit. This goes via the definition of line styles for each
  sectioning level used in the document. The package provides
  its own custom line styles. Simpler ones are given as
  examples in the documentation. The simplest usage will be to
  take advantage of the layout facilities of packages dealing
  with list environments.

  The \tableofcontents command may be used arbitrarily many
  times and it has a variant \localtableofcontents which
  prints tables of contents `local' to the current surrounding
  document unit. An extension of the \label/\ref syntax allows
  to reproduce (with another layout) a TOC defined somewhere
  else in the document.

  The formatting inherited (and possibly customized by other
  packages) from the document class may also be used in
  compatibility mode. Regarding the global toc display, etoc
  provides pre-defined styles based on a multi-column format,
  optionally with a frame or a ruled title.

  As the assignment of levels to the sectioning units can be
  changed at any time, etoc can be used in a quite general
  manner to also create custom "lists of", additionally to the
  tables of contents related to the document sectioning units.
  No auxiliary file is used apart from the usual .toc file.


Change log
==========

   v1.07f [2013/03/07]

   new macros \etocthelinkedname, \etocthelinkednumber,
   \etocthelinkedpage, and \etocthelink.


   v1.07e [2013/03/01]

   improvements in the package own line styles with
   regards to penalties and vertical spaces. 

   addition to the documentation of an example of
   a tree-like table of contents (uses tikz).

   more such examples added 2013/03/03.


   v1.07d [2013/02/24]

   minor code improvements and new documentation 
   section "Another compatibility mode".


   v1.07b [2013/02/02]

   removal of the \xspace from the macros \etocname, 
   \etocnumber, \etocpage.

   additional examples in the documentation.

   
   v1.07 [2013/01/29]

   new commands:

      \etocthename, \etocthenumber, \etocthepage, \etoclink, 

      \etoctoccontentsline, \etoctoccontentsline*

      \etocnopar, \etocaftercontentshook

   modified command: \etocmulticolstyle

   new documentation section "Surprising uses of etoc" which
   explains how to do "Lists of arbitrary things", in
   addition to the tables of contents.


   v1.06 [2012/12/07]

   the standard macros \l@section etc... are modified only
   during the calls to \tableofcontents; they can thus be
   customized as will by the user (with the help of a
   package like tocloft) and this will be taken into account
   by etoc for the TOCs typeset in compatibility mode.


   v1.05 [2012/12/01]

   \localtableofcontents replaces \tableofcontents* (for
   compatibility with the memoir class).

   compatibility with KOMA-script and memoir document
   classes.


   v1.04 [2012/11/24]

   a (possibly local) table of contents can be labeled:
 
       \tableofcontents \label{toc:1}

   and reproduced elsewhere in the document (with a possibly
   completely different layout):
 
       \tableofcontents \ref{toc:1}

   
   v1.02 [2012/11/18]

   initial version.
