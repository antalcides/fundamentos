      some redundant code. Fixed problems caused with
      hyperlinks when using a mixture of counters for
      individual entries. Added extra \hyper<xx> page 
      formats. Added hook to provide a sub header when
      using a tabular style glossary. Added means of
      specifying a column header for page list column.

      *** is advisable to delete your .gls etc files ***
